# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup work performed on the automated trading system codebase to improve organization, maintainability, and overall project structure.

## Work Completed

### 1. Log Management System
- Created organized log directory structure (`logs/freqtrade/`, `logs/web_ui/`, `logs/system/`)
- Implemented automated log archiving for files older than 7 days
- Updated startup scripts to use new log locations
- Removed duplicate and obsolete log files

### 2. Configuration File Organization
- Consolidated configuration files into the `config/` directory
- Created subdirectories for different environments (`config/backtesting/`, `config/live/`)
- Updated code references to use new config paths
- Removed duplicate configuration files

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Updated main `README.md` to reflect current project structure
- Created comprehensive documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Updated all relevant documentation files with current information

### 4. Temporary File Cleanup
- Removed all Python cache files (`__pycache__/`)
- Deleted compiled Python files (`.pyc`)
- Cleaned up temporary and backup files
- Implemented proper `.gitignore` rules

### 5. Version Control Improvements
- Created comprehensive `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files
- Ensured only relevant files are tracked in version control
- Established best practices for repository organization

### 6. Scripts and Automation
- Created automated cleanup scripts for regular maintenance
- Developed log management and archiving scripts
- Implemented configuration file organization tools

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear organization makes it easier to find and modify files
2. **Reduced Clutter**: Removed unnecessary files and directories
3. **Better Performance**: Cleaned up cache and temporary files that were consuming disk space
4. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Clear structure and documentation make it easier for new developers to contribute
5. **Automated Maintenance**: Scripts in place for ongoing cleanup and organization

## Next Steps

1. Regular execution of cleanup scripts to maintain organization
2. Continued documentation updates as the project evolves
3. Monitoring of log file growth and adjustment of retention policies as needed
4. Periodic review of dependencies in `requirements.txt`

## Scripts for Ongoing Maintenance

- `scripts/codebase_cleanup.py` - Comprehensive cleanup of temporary files and cache
- `scripts/cleanup_old_logs.py` - Archive old log files based on retention policy

These scripts can be run manually or scheduled to run automatically to maintain the clean organization of the codebase.
